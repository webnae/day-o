      <p>The first fruit to exist originated in Malaysian jungles, later discovered to thrive in other Southeast Asian countries and Latin America. They take nine months to fully blossom and after their stem is chopped down, a new plant grows from its rhizome, or root clump. Not quite a tree, the herb towers over 15 feet and produces around 200 harvestables. It’s a key factor to the economies of many countries worldwide, including Ecuador, Guatemala, and the Philippines.

The Banana Boat Song describes the work ethic and underlying desires of banana farmers in the Caribbean. This call-and-response work song was recorded a few different ways from musicians Edric Connor, Louise Bennett, and Harry Belafonte. Most recognizable of these 3 versions would be Harry Belafonte’s, which was rewritten and may also be recognized by the “day-o” added to the song. This work song specifically captures Jamaican farmers’ work days by explaining that sunrise indicated it was time to return home, as working at night meant avoiding the heat. Near the beginning of the twentieth century bananas were Jamaica’s primary export and bananas continue to be a highly exported crop globally. The introduction of this song to the U.S. worked in Belafonte’s favor, with his rendition of the 60 year old work song charting at number 5. We don’t hear about work songs much anymore, though surely they must exist. The Jamaican farmers, other Caribbean farmers, Brazilian, Filipino farmers all have their own song to get them through the day. Is a song enough?

On the flip side, we see a very American Youtube series, Charlie the Unicorn, featuring the song Put A Banana in Your Ear. The song, presented alongside communist symbols and dancing bananas, posits that the popular fruit is effective in blocking out nonsense when used to plug your “favorite ear.” This is also claimed to improve one’s mood year round, which incidentally parallels the banana’s growing season, which is all year. While both banana-forward songs intend to uplift and inspire, one key difference is the underlying call to action. In Your Ear, the banana would shield you from bossman demands and absurd political ideals; Day-O, however, is meant to be sung <i>while</i> working. One serves to go against the bourgeoisie while the other adheres to the monotonous work conditions of a population heavily reliant on the harvesting and exporting of bananas.</p>
